This kata is a Kotlin multiplatform version of the kata [KataTODOApiClientKotlin][KataTODOApiClientKotlin] of [Karumi][karumi].

- We are here to practice integration testing using HTTP stubbing. 
- We are going to use [KtorClientMock][ktorclientmock] to return stub responses.
- We are going to use [KotlinTest][kotlintest] to write tests and to perform assertions.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Getting started

This repository contains an kotlin multiplatform library with an API client to interact with the [JSONPlaceholder service](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

This API Client is based on one class with name ``TodoApiClient`` containing some methods to interact with the API. Using this class we can get all the tasks, get a task using the task id, add a new task, update a task or delete an already created task.

The API client has been implemented using a multiplatform networking framework named [Ktor][ktor]. Review the project documentation if needed.

## Tasks

Your task as a multiplatform Kotlin Developer is to **write all the integration tests** needed to check if the API Client is working as expected.

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle using ktlint and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**

My recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository.
    2. Checkout `integration-testing-kotlin-multiplatform-kata` branch.
    3. Execute the repository playground and make yourself familiar with the code.
    4. Execute `TodoApiClientShould` and watch the only test it contains pass.

  * To help you get started, these are some tests already written at `TodoApiClientShould ` class. Review it carefully before to start writing your own tests. Here you have the description of some tests you can write to start working on this Kata:
	1. Test that the ``Accept`` headers are sent.
    2. Test that the list of ``Task`` instances obtained invoking the getter method of the property ``allTasks``  contains the expected values.
    3. Test that the request is sent to the correct path using the correct HTTP method.
    4. Test that adding a task the body sent to the server is the correct one.

## Considerations

* If you get stuck, `master` branch contains all the tests already solved.

* You will find some utilities to help you test the APIClient easily in:
  ``TodoApiMockEngine`` and the common/responses directory in commonTest source set.

## Extra Tasks

If you've covered all the application functionality using integration tests you can continue with some extra tasks: 

* Create your own API client to consume one of the services described in this web: [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/][jsonplaceholder]
